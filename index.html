	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<p>I work in the Legal and Risk Services Department at Yale New Haven Health, and current living in Stratford, CT. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I have always had an interest in technology, and when I found General Assembly, I thought it would be fun to try a web design course.</p>

	<h2>MY MISSION</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a web designer either as a free-lancer, or with a larger company such as Go Daddy!</p>
